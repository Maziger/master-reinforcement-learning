# 6.6.1 - Sequential decisions problems

1. Think of two sequential decision problems and try to formulate them as MDPs. Describe the states, actions and rewards in words.
   * 2D video game shooter: States (Player position, health, ammo, enemy position, level progress), Actions (Move left/right, jump/crouch, shoot left/right),
     Rewards (10 points for eliminating enemy, -20 points for taking damage, 200 points for level finish)
   * Inventory management: States (Inventory level), Actions (Buy x amount of units, wait), Rewards (negative number representing inventory holding cost plus
     procurement costs [Because we want to minimise costs in inventory management])
